# Regex Tutorial

Briefly explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

A regular expression is a string representing a pattern for matching some portion of a string.

### Anchors

 They don't match any characters, but assert something about the string or the matching process.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.

### OR Operator

The | character is used as an and/or character

### Character Classes

Character classes recognize characters such as distinguishing between letters and digits.

### Flags

Regular expressions may have flags that affect the search.

### Grouping and Capturing

Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions can be used to match a single character or collating element.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

There are two operation modes for quantifiers.

### Boundaries

A word boundary is a position between a non word character, or at the beginning or end of a string if it begins or ends with a word character.

### Back-references

Backreferences match the same text already matched by a group.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and Look-behind allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them
