## Regex Components

A regular expression is a string representing a pattern for matching some portion of a string.

### Anchors

 They don't match any characters, but assert something about the string or the matching process.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.

### OR Operator

The | character is used as an and/or character

### Character Classes

Character classes recognize characters such as distinguishing between letters and digits.

### Flags

Regular expressions may have flags that affect the search.

### Grouping and Capturing



### Bracket Expressions



### Greedy and Lazy Match



### Boundaries



### Back-references



### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and Look-behind allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them
